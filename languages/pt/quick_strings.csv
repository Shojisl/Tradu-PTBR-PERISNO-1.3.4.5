qstr_This_area_of_{s1}_can_best_be_described_|This area of {s1} can best be described as the very core of the town.^^ You can almost see the strings that are being pulled from here, the money that comes and goes at seemingly endless rates.  Here you can buy the land that is cultivated outside the towns gates and benefit from the ones working hard. Of course you might not have the aurums required to do so, but the moneylenders are known to have some spare change.{***}
qstr_{reg1}_people_live_in_{s1}._There_are_cu|{reg1} people live in {s1}. There are currently {reg2} acres of land available for cultivation to provide them with food and other goods. You own {reg3} acres of land in this town. You currently owe the moneylenders of {s1} {reg4} aurums. The interest rate is 20% and the contract period amounts to 2 weeks. If you don't manage to pay off your debt until the deadline, the interest is raised to 40%. Buying an existing acre costs {reg9} aurums, while it sells for {reg10} aurums. Building a new one requires {reg11} aurums. The rent paid to landowners currently accumulates to {reg13} aurums per acre every week and has to be collected in the town. Land won't be rented if a town is already well supplied.{***}

qstr_Low:^^___Center_points_for_fief_allocati|Low:^^ - Center points for fief allocation are calculated (villages 1 / castles 2 / towns 3) instead of (villages 1 / castles 1 / towns 2).^^ - For qst rescue prisoner and qst offer gift, the relatives that can be a target of the quest have been extended to include uncles and aunts and in-laws.^^ - Alterations to script calculate troop score for center (these changes currently are only relevant during claimant quests).^^ - When picking a new faction, lords are more likely to return to their original faction (except when that's the faction they're being exiled from), if the ordinary conditions for rejoining are met.  A lord's decision may also be influenced by his relations with other lords in the various factions, instead of just his relations with the faction leaders.^^Medium:^^ - Some changes for lord relation gains/losses when fiefs are allocated.^^ - Kings overrule lords slightly less frequently on faction issues.^^ - In deciding who to support for a fief, minor parameter changes for certain personalities. Some lords will still give priority to fiefless lords or to the lord who conquered the center if they have a slightly negative relation (normally the cutoff is 0 for all personalities).^^ - When a lord can't find any good candidates for a fief under the normal rules, instead of automatically supporting himself he uses a weighted scoring scheme.^^ - In various places where 'average renown * 3/2' appears, an alternate calculation is sometimes used.^^High:^^ - The 'renown factor' when an NPC lord or the player courts and NPC lady is adjusted by the prestige of the lady's guardian.^^ - When a faction has fiefless lords and no free fiefs left, under some circumstances the king will redistribute a village he owns.^^{***}
qstr_Low:^^___Caravan_trade_benefits_both_the|Low:^^ - Caravan trade benefits both the source and the destination^^ - When the player surrenders, there is a chance his personal equipment will not be looted, based on who accepted the surrender and the difficulty setting. (This is meant to address a gameplay issue. In the first 700 days or so, there is no possible benefit to surrendering rather than fighting to the last man.) Also, a bug that made it possible for books etc. to be looted was corrected.^^ - AI caravans take into consideration distance when choosing their next destination and will be slightly more like to visit their own faction. This strategy is mixed with the Native one, so the trade pattern will differ but not wildly.^^ - Scale town merchant gold by prosperity (up to a maximum 40% change).^^ - Food prices increase in towns that have been under siege for at least 48 hours.^^ - In towns the trade penalty script has been tweaked to make it more efficient to sell goods to merchants specializing in them.^^Medium:^^ - Food consumption increases in towns as prosperity increases.^^   Consumption also increases with garrison sizes.^^ - Lords' looting skill affects how much gold they take from the player when they defeat him.^^ - Lords' leadership skill modifies their troop wage costs the same way it does for the player.^^ - The player can lose gold when his fiefs are looted, like lords.^^ - The same way that lord party sizes increase as the player progresses, mercenary party sizes also increase to maintain their relevance. (The rate is the same as for lords: a 1.25% increase per level.)^^ - If the player has a kingdom of his own, his spouse will receive part of the bonus that ordinarily would be due a liege.  The extent of this bonus depends on the number of fiefs the players holds. This bonus is non-cumulative with the marshall bonus.^^ - Attrition is inflicted on NPC-owned centers if they can't pay wages, but only above a certain threshold.^^ - Strangers cannot acquire enterprises (enforced at 1 instead of at 0, so you have to do something).^^High: - The total amount of weekly bonus gold awarded to kings in Calradia   remains constant: as kings go into exile, their bonuses are divided among the remaining kings.^^ - If lord's run a personal gold surplus after party wages, the extra is divided among the lord and his garrisons budgets (each castle and town has its own pool of funds to pay for soldiers) on the basis of whether the lord is low on gold or any of his fortresses are. (If none are low   on gold, the lord takes everything, like before.)^^ - The honor loss from an offense depends in part on the player's honor   at the time.  The purer the reputation, the greater the effect of a single disagrace.^^ - Raiding change: village gold lost is removed from uncollected taxes before the balance (if any) is removed from the lord.^^ - Cash for prisoners{***}
qstr_Disabled_levels_the_playing_field_for_fe|Disabled levels the playing-field for female player characters. Default as in Native. High increases the sexism/anti-woman prejudice of the medieval setting for female player characters.{***}

qstr_Humans_are_varied_as_their_cultures_and_|Humans are varied as their cultures, and this is no less true in Perisno as anywhere else. They are often viewed as bland and relatively talentless by the older races, with nothing to separate them in their features save for their differing cultures.  They reside in all parts of Perisno, to say nothing of the world. In the North reside the Republic of Maccavia, the Kingdom of Tolrania, the Reich des Drachen, and the Valahir Clans. To the South lie the Hakkon Empire, the Draharan Sultanate, and the Kuu-lan Hordes. To the far West, stories tell of the Aroulo people, who have lived in secrecy since the days of the old Empire. Meanwhile, across all of Perisno reside many who claim their heritage from the old Perisno Empire. Yet whisperings tell of a great empire, who travels the vast oceans to Perisno much like the Hakkon before them. Their black sails herald a new age in Perisno, and only time will tell what their arrival may bring...{***}
qstr__There_is_beauty_and_then_there_are_Naph|'There is beauty, and then there are Naphali.' Often described as otherwordly beautiful, Naphali are lithe, slender, and dextrous people. They are master archers, and are incredibly long-lived. They claim to have always been in Perisno, residing in what the old Empire once referred to as the Great Redwood Forest, although the Dwarves vehemently challenge this notion, citing their mutual history of conflict. Three Naphali nations reside in the various Western forests. Elintor, lead by Queen Arwen, resides in their claimed homeland South of Tolrania. To their West, their ancient kin and rivals, the Geldar, who hate the Elintor for persecuting and isolating them. To the South resides the Realm of the Falcon, a militarily-led, democratic nation that largely keeps to itself, but is renowned for its powerful elite warriors.{***}
qstr__The_Dwarves_are_as_old_as_Perisno_itsel|'The Dwarves are as old as Perisno itself.' This is a common phrase used throughout Perisno to tell of the reclusive and secretive Dwarves. Short, but stout, the Dwarves are master craftsmen, blacksmiths, and miners, and their architechts are the envy of the world. Once an integral part of the old Perisno Empire, their vast and wealthy cities within the Southern Mountains once drew the line between Perisno and the great Southern continent of Canaan. Now, in the wake of the Naphali invasion, the dwarven Kaikoth Confederation is but a shadow of its former self.{***}
qstr_Giants_are_a_proud_ancient_race_well_kno|Giants are a proud, ancient race well known to the lands of Perisno, alongside the enigmatic Naphali and the secretive Dwarves. Often viewed by the other races as being stupid or slow. They are physically large and powerful, exerting strength often two to three times greater than the average Perisnoan. They are divided into two factions; the Chieftom of Sut, an ancient tribe residing in the mountains East of the Reich, who are reclusive and traditionalist by nature, and the Kingdom of Bakhal, a war-like nation that dwells far to the East of the Sea of Sorrow, who make up the diaspora that once were the tribes that resided across Perisno and who view their Western Sut kin as race traitors..{***}
qstr_You_were_born_into_this_world_the_{reg3?|You were born into this world the {reg3?daughter:son} of a family of warriors and fishermen on your small island, that your kinsmen called Hylr.^^Your father had the name Izgromar, but he died when you were young. Your only memory of him is the time he returned from a raid, and taught you to throw the spear. Following his death, besides fishing for subsistence, you spent your early days training, your goal to honor the name of your father.^^You were poorer than most, but given your skill with the spear, you did not go hungry much. As you grew older, you trained more with your weapons, and finally were accepted to the next raiding party travelling to the rich Valahir lands to the south.^^The raid went well at first. When a Valahir patrol came upon the party, your leader, Torsson, managed to fight off three Hersirs singlehandedly. You even managed to kill a Thrall or two. However, one bit of Valahir scum in the patrol managed to escape, and soon after, Aethling Svafar himself descended upon you. Your wits left you, and several other men, and you and your party rode back to your ship as fast as humanly possible on your stolen horses, left with but a pittance; without your leader.{***}
qstr_You_never_knew_your_mother_no_doubt_some|You never knew your mother, no doubt some whore your father took a fancy to on his travels. All that was told to you was that one time when your father returned from a trading voyage, he brought a child with him, claiming it to be his seed.^^You grew up helping him with his trading, living well in whatever city you were in, then coming back to the village for a time to deposit your earnings in your growing estate.^^Then, you went onto one more trading mission. This one was to the Aroulo islands to the west, tribal places, mostly ignored by the powerful kingdoms in Perisno.^^To your dismay, a group of pirates attacked your ship, destroying it and killing your father, along with the rest of the crew. You managed to escape by swimming to a nearby island.{***}
qstr_You_began_your_life_as_a_young_Dwarf_bor|You began your life as a young Dwarf born to a Kaikoth Ironfist, one of the fiercest dwarven fighters around. However, your father died in a war with the Hakkon Empire when you were but an infant, and you were raised by your mother.^^Your father's brothers in arms taught you how to the basics in wielding a sword when you were young, but, as life went on, those father figures soon left your life. Their training, however, stayed with you. At this point your mother had sold off the rest of your father's wealth; save for one banner from his conquests, which she refused to sell.^^You were forced to take up work in the mines, even as a young {reg3?girl:boy}, to provide for your family. You managed to eke out a living and provide for your mother, but not much else.^^Eventually, you were able to earn yourself dwarven armor of your own by squiring to one of the ironfists, your father's former comrade. This meant you needed to work in the mines even more however; to provide for your family and for half the cost of each piece of your expensive equipment. However, one day you saw something amiss in the mines...{***}

qstr_You_couldn_t_just_stay_aside_when_a_near|You couldn't just stay aside when a nearby kingdom attacked your faction, so you were among the first to join the army.

qstr_It_became_both_your_work_and_hobby._Firs|It became both your work and hobby. First of all, you just liked capturing criminals and locking them up in prisons. At the same time, your good tracking skill got you a lot of money for a couple of difficult bounties.{***}

qstr_Though_the_distinction_felt_sudden_to_yo|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {reg3?woman:man}, and the whole world seemed to change around you. You pursued a career as a smith, crafting items of function and beauty out of simple metal. As time wore on you became a master of your trade, and fine work started to fetch fine prices. With food in your belly and logs on your fire, you could take pride in your work and your growing reputation.{***}
qstr_a_physician|a physician{***}
qstr_It_all_started_unexpectedly:_one_day_you|It all started unexpectedly: one day you caught a strange desease no doctor in your area could heal. Fighting for your life, you travelled a long way to Galwe and spent several weeks consulting with renowned doctors, but mostly, due to lack of their time and your money, studying coursebooks in the library. Eventually you found the exact description of your desease in an old book, followed by a detailed recipe of the cure, which you managed to prepare without anyone else's help. And although this short period of self-education didn't make an actual doctor, you still learned a lot about deseases, treatments and medicine in general.{***}

When you were named squire to a noble at court, you practiced long hours with weapons, learning how to deal out hard knocks and how to take them, too.  You were instructed in your obligations to your lord, and of your duties to those who might one day be your vassals.  But in addition to learning the chivalric ideal, you also learned about the less uplifting side -- old warriors' stories of ruthless power politics, of betrayals and usurpations, of men who used guile as well as valor to achieve their aims.{***}

qstr_Though_the_distinction_felt_sudden_to_you_|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {reg3?woman:man}, and the whole world seemed to change around you.  You joined the tightly-knit circle of women at court, ladies who all did proper ladylike things, the wives and mistresses of noble men as well as maidens who had yet to find a husband.  However, even here you found politics at work as the ladies schemed for prominence and fought each other bitterly to catch the eye of whatever unmarried man was in fashion at court.  You soon learned ways of turning these situations and goings-on to your advantage. With it came the realisation that you yourself could wield great influence in the world, if only you applied yourself with a little bit of subtlety.{***}
